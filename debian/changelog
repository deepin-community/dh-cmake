  [ Kyle Edwards ]
  * Added examples.
  * Changed CMake installation to use cmake --install instead of
    cmake_install.cmake script.
  * Changed cmake dependency to "Recommends" instead of "Depends".
  * Added `Provides: dh-sequence-{cmake,ctest,cpack}` to binary package.
  * Updated to use modern debhelper-compat dependency.
  * Bumped Debian policy version.
  * Now notifies Debhelper when CMake installs files.
  * Added modernized compat mechanism with the pseudo-package dh-cmake-compat.
  * Added --component argument to dh_cmake_install.
  * dh_ctest_test now calls ctest instead of dh_auto_test.
  * dh_cpack_substvars now ignores packages not specified by --package if it
    is specified.
  * Added --ctest-build and --ctest-build-suffix arguments to dh_ctest_*.
  * Added --ctest-testing-dir argument to dh_ctest_*.
  * Added quoting and backslashes to DEB_CTEST_OPTIONS.
  * Added track and catchfailed options to DEB_CTEST_OPTIONS.
  * Added dh_ctest_update step.
  * Added dh_ctest_clean step.

dh-cmake (0.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Changed dh_cmake_install to use an absolute installation prefix.
  * Changed the dh_ctest_* steps to each do their own submit step, and
    removed dh_ctest_submit from the default ctest sequence. dh_ctest_submit
    still exists, and you can pass --no-submit to the commands to keep the old
    behavior.
  * Added a new --parts argument to dh_ctest_submit to only submit some parts
    to CDash.
  * Added a compat level file, dh-cmake.compat, for future-proofing.
  * Added new "site" and "build" options to DEB_CTEST_OPTIONS to control the
    build and site names submitted to CDash.
  * Added support for package architectures other than "any" and "all".
  * Added support for the new CPack External generator provided by CPack. This
    allows dh-cmake to install CPack components and component groups in
    specific packages, and use the CPack dependency graph in the output
    packages.
  * Added dpkg-dev to the dependencies (for dpkg-architecture).
  * Added -VV argument to CTest calls to get output from invoked commands.
